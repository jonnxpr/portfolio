# GEMINI.md - Antigravity Entry Point (Portfolio)

This repository must stay consistent across OpenCode, GitHub Copilot VS Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Antigravity.

Canonical precedence: `.copilot/base-instructions.md` -> `CLAUDE.md` -> `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

Use `CLAUDE.md` as the canonical workflow contract.

## Hard preflight gate (mandatory)

1. Read all mandatory files for the active context.
2. Start the response with:
   - `Preflight OK: <file1>, <file2>, ...`

If preflight is incomplete, reply only:

- `BLOCKED: preflight incompleto`

and provide one objective next step.

## Mandatory loading order

1. `.copilot/base-instructions.md`
2. `CLAUDE.md`
3. `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
4. `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`
5. `.github/skills/development-standards/SKILL.md`
6. `.agent/skills/development-standards/SKILL.md`
7. `.github/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md` or `.opencode/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md` for design-centric work
8. `.agent/rules/development-standards.md`

## Mandatory rules

- Preserve visual language, responsiveness, and semantic structure.
- Keep build artifacts aligned with source changes.
- For commit creation or commit message generation, read `.github/copilot-commit-message-instructions.md`.
- If `tasks/` exists, read `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`; if `tasks/` is missing, create both first.
- This is a non-Java workspace.

## Context7 documentation policy (mandatory)

- Use Context7 before implementation, refactor, and review decisions.

## MCP credential discovery and connection consent (mandatory)

- Before connecting to any MCP server, request user confirmation and list the credential source(s) to be used (redacted; never print secret values).
- Discovery must include workspace/project files, OpenCode config, `.copilot/mcp-config.json`, VS Code `profiles/*/mcp.json`, `~/.gemini/antigravity/mcp_config.json`, and referenced environment variables such as `CONTEXT7_API_KEY`.
- If credentials are not found, report exactly: `credentials not found for requested MCP`.

## Mandatory multi-agent orchestration skill

- For non-trivial tasks, apply `orchestrate-multi-agents` before implementation and keep the `Template DAG 100% compliance`.
- For non-trivial tasks, instantiate the `Template DAG 100% compliance` from `orchestrate-multi-agents`; owners/tasks may be reduced only when not applicable, but mandatory gates cannot be removed.

## Mandatory final code review, cross-validation, and factual integrity

- No technical task is done without final review plus evidence-based cross-validation.

## Governance automation (mandatory)

- Secret scan: `./tools/governance/scan-secrets.ps1`
- Instruction sync: `python ./tools/governance/sync-instructions.py`
- Compliance audit: `python ./tools/governance/audit-compliance.py`
